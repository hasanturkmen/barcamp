BarCamp Deland is an ad-hoc unconference event centered around technology. It aims to bring people together from different backgrounds like web-design, photography, graphic design, art, music, web-development and technology for cooperative learning. <span class="hidden-phone">It's an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join. When you come, be prepared to share.</span></p>

<h2>Participants wanted!</h2>
<p>Attendees are encouraged to give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer/contribute in some way to support the event. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall. The people present at the event will select the demos or presentations they want to see. <span class="hidden-phone">Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those who canâ€™t be present.</span></p>
